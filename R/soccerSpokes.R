#' @include soccerHeatmap.R, soccerFlow.R
NULL
#' Draws a 'wagon wheel' plot with spokes showing the direction of all movements made in each sector of the pitch.
#' Note: This function is prototypical and intended to eventually visualise pass and shot event data, but there are no open-source samples of such data available as yet.
#' 
#' @param df dataframe containing x,y-coordinates of player position in columns named \code{'x'} and \code{'y'}, and angular information of these events in a column \code{'direction'}
#' @param bins integer, the number of horizontal bins (length-wise) the soccer pitch is to be divided up into. If no value for \code{yBins} is provided, this value will also be used for the number of vertical (width-wise) bins.
#' @param lengthPitch,widthPitch numeric, length and width of pitch in metres.
#' @param yBins integer, the number of vertical bins (width-wise) the soccer patch is to be divided up into. If \code{NULL}, the same value is used as for \code{bins}
#' @param grass if TRUE, draws pitch background in green and lines in white. If FALSE, draws pitch background in white and lines in black.
#' @param plot optional, adds spokes to an existing ggplot object if provided
#' @return a ggplot object of a heatmap on a soccer pitch.
